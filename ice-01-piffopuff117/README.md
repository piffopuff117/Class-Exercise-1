## Simple Class Design

### Assignment Overview

Create a class named `Player` that initializes a player with default name, "player", default level set to 0, and default character type "default." Create a function that prints our all Player information in a nicely formatted way. Create another function that compares two Players based on their level. If the two Players have the save level, print "tie." Write a main program that creates and compares two instances of Player with random levels between 1 and 99.
